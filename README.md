# binary-splitting---regression-tree

I wrote these functions to do binary recursive splitting of two continuous variables. This is a fundamental part of regression/classification trees. I wanted a better understanding of whats happening underneath these methods, so it was more for teaching than improving efficiency.

Right now it's at the point where it will split data once, I haven't gotten to the point to make it recursive. But the output is conducive to making it like that.
