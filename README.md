# binary-splitting---regression-tree

I wrote these functions to do binary recursive splitting of two continuous variables for a classification/regression tree. Implemented for teaching rather than efficiency.

Right now it's at the point where it will split data once, I haven't gotten to the point to make it recursive. But the output is conducive to making it like that.
